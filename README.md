Challenge 1 <a name="challenge1"></a>
The challenge is to convert a 12-hour time format into a 24-hour format.

The file challenge1.py contains the function convert_to_24(hour, minute, period). This function takes three parameters:

hour: an integer representing the hour part of the time.
minute: an integer representing the minutes part of the time.
period: a string representing whether the time is AM or PM.
The corresponding test_challenge1.py file uses the unittest module to assert the correctness of this function.

Challenge 2 <a name="challenge2"></a>
The challenge is to find out if out of three numbers, exactly two are positive.

The file challenge2.py contains the function two_positive(a, b, c). This function takes three parameters, representing three numbers, and returns a boolean indicating whether exactly two of them are positive.

The corresponding test_challenge2.py file uses the unittest module to assert the correctness of this function.

Challenge 3 <a name="challenge3"></a>
The challenge here is to solve a problem related to strings manipulation.

The file challenge3.py contains the function solve(s). This function takes a string as a parameter and performs a specific operation according to the problem's conditions.

The corresponding test_challenge3.py file uses the unittest module to assert the correctness of this function.
